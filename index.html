				<p>I am a third-year student at Cornell University, looking for summer internships in the software industry. As a CS major, I'm fascinated by the breadth of services computer science can accomplish.</p>

				<p>As such, I have explored a wide variety of CS projects including web development, university research, computer-aided design, and data integration web services. I am continuing to develop skills in specifying, designing, building, testing, and delivering reliable software systems.  I intend to pursue a full-stack development track to improve the lives of people around me from all angles.</p>

				<p>Outside of academics, I am an avid fan of film. In fact, I have seen 967 movies in my lifetime.</p></div>
