            <p>Hi, my name is Erik Chan. I am a third-year student at Cornell University, looking for summer internships in the software industry. As a CS major, I'm fascinated by the breadth of services computer science can accomplish.</p>

            <p>As such, I have explored a wide variety of CS projects including web development, university research, computer-aided design, and data integration web services. I am continuing to develop skills in specifying, designing, building, testing, and delivering reliable software systems. I intend to pursue a full-stack development track to improve the lives of people around me from all angles.</p>

            <p>Outside of academics, I am an avid fan of film. In fact, I have seen 986 movies in my lifetime.</p>
